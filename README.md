# niwarren.co.uk

Source Code for the website niwarren.co.uk

The website is a personal project of mine, and as such - no edits are permitted

I started the project with the aim of teaching myself the skills required to build such a site, such as HTML/CSS, Web hosting on Linux, and basic Source Version Control.

Currently, the master branch is being hosted and can be found at "niwarren.co.uk".
