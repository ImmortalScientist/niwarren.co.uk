# niwarren.co.uk

Source Code for the website niwarren.co.uk

The website is a personal project of mine, and as such - no edits are permitted

I started the project with the aim of teaching myself the skills required to build such a site, such as HTML/CSS, Web hosting on Linux, and basic Source Version Control.

The current plan is to host the site from a Raspberry Pi computer, where the site code is pulled from a Git repository. As yet, the server is live - however the site's code has not been added (the Apache default page is shown)
